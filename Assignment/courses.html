                <section>
                    <p class="welcome" id="arraylists">
                        In this session, we will focus on a very versatile data
                        structure in Java: the ArrayList. But before we do that,
                        let's quicklly recap what we know about arrays.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arrays are a basic structue that allows you to store
                        multiple values of the same type together. Remember, an
                        array's size is fixed once it's created. They're like
                        the fixed-sized suitcases of our program; no matter
                        what, you cannot change the size without creating a new
                        one.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key points</h4>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Arrays have a fixed length</li>
                        <li>The index of the first element is 0</li>
                        <li>Arrays are fast for indexed data access</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now let's move on to ArrayLists</p>
                    <h3>Introduction to ArrayLists</h3>
                    <p>
                        ArrayLists are part of the Java Collections Framework
                        and are a step up from traditional arrays for several
                        reasons. They are dynamic, meaning they can change size
                        at runtime. Think of an ArrayList as an expandable bag;
                        you can keep adding items to it, and it will grow to
                        accommodate them.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why ArrayLists?</h4>
                    <p>
                        ArrayLists are essential because they offer flexibility.
                        When dealing with a collection of elements that varies
                        in size, ArrayLists are your go-to data structure.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Core Concepts of ArrayLists</h4>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Dynamic Sizing:</strong> Unlike arrays,
                            ArrayLists can grow and shrink during the execution
                            of a program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Type Safety:</strong> ArrayLists use
                            generics, which means you can define an ArrayList of
                            a specific type, such as <em>Integer</em> or
                            <em>String</em>, and it will only accept that type.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>API Methods:</strong> They come with several
                            useful methods such as <code>add()</code>,
                            <code>remove()</code>, <code>size()</code>,
                            <code>isEmpty()</code>, and more which make them
                            very powerful.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Hands-On Practice: Working with ArrayLists</h4>
                    <p>
                        Alright, let's get our hands dirty with some code. I'll
                        start with a simple example, and then you'll have a
                        chance to try it out.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
                    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; studentNames = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
                        studentNames.add("Anjy");
                        studentNames.add("Freya");
                        System.out.println(studentNames); <span>// Output will be [Anjy, Freya]</span>
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Notice how we can add elements without worrying about
                        the size of the ArrayList.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Your Turn</h5>
                    <p>
                        Now, I want you to create an ArrayList to store decimal
                        numbers (Double) and add five values to it. Then, use a
                        loop to calculate the sum of these values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Real-Time Feedback:</strong> Use the in-class
                        chat to ask questions as you go. I'll be here to provide
                        assistance and feedback in real-time.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Deep Dive: Methods of ArrayList</h4>
                    <p>
                        Let's examine some of the common methods of the
                        ArrayList class and see them in action.

                            element at the specified position in this list with
                            the specified element.

                            <code>remove(int index):</code>Removes the element
                            at the specified position in this list.

                    <h4>ArrayList in Action: A Real-world Application</h4>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you're working on an application for a
                        bookstore. You have an inventory of books, and you need
                        to manage it dynamically. Books can be added, sold
                        (removed), and updated. An ArrayList is perfect for this
                        scenario.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Introduction to LinkedLists</h3>
                    <p>
                        A LinkedList is a dynamic data structure that consists
                        of a sequence of elements, each linked to the next.
                        Unlike arrays or ArrayLists, LinkedLists store elements
                        in a non-contiguous fashion, meaning that each element
                        can be anywhere in memory, but they're connected through
                        "links" or references.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Points:</h4>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Each element (commonly called a node) contains two
                            parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the
                            next node in the sequence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            LinkedLists are dynamic, so they can grow and shrink
                            at runtime.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They provide faster insertion and deletion compared
                            to arrays, especially for large lists of data.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Understanding the Node Structure</h4>
                    <p>
                        The fundamental component of a LinkedList is the "node."
                        Let's take a closer look:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
                    class Node {
                    Object data; // The data stored in the node
                    Node next;   // The reference to the next node
                }</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Each node has a data field, where we store our data, and
                        a next field, which is a reference pointing to the next
                        node in the list.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Operations in a LinkedList</h4>
                    <p>
                        LinkedLists support various operations. Here we'll cover
                        the basics:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Adding Elements: You can add elements at the
                            beginning, end, or middle of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Removing Elements: Similarly, you can remove
                            elements from any part of the list without having to
                            shift elements like in an array.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Searching: You can search for elements, but it may
                            take longer than in an ArrayList because you have to
                            traverse the list from the beginning.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Detailed Look at LinkedList Methods</h2>
                    <p>
                        LinkedLists in Java come with a robust set of methods
                        that allow for efficient manipulation of data. Let's go
                        through some of these methods and see how we can use
                        them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Adding Elements</h3>
                    <ul class="method-list">
                        <li>
                            <code>add(E e)</code>: Appends the specified element
                            to the end of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>addFirst(E e)</code>: Inserts the specified
                            element at the beginning of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>addLast(E e)</code>: Appends the specified
                            element to the end of the list (similar to add).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>add(int index, E element)</code>: Inserts the
                            element at the specified position in the list.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Removing Elements</h3>
                    <ul class="method-list">
                        <li>
                            <code>remove()</code>: Removes and returns the first
                            element of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>remove(int index)</code>: Removes the element
                            at the specified position in the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>removeFirst()</code>: Removes and returns the
                            first element of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>removeLast()</code>: Removes and returns the
                            last element of the list.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Accessing Elements</h3>
                    <ul class="method-list">
                        <li>
                            <code>getFirst()</code>: Returns the first element
                            in the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>getLast()</code>: Returns the last element in
                            the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>get(int index)</code>: Returns the element at
                            the specified position in the list.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Other Useful Methods</h3>
                    <ul class="method-list">
                        <li>
                            <code>size()</code>: Returns the number of elements
                            in the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>contains(Object o)</code>: Returns true if the
                            list contains the specified element.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>indexOf(Object o)</code>: Returns the index of
                            the first occurrence of the specified element, or -1
                            if the list does not contain the element.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Interactive Activity: Method Exploration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now, let's use some of these methods in an interactive
                        coding activity.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>LinkedList&lt;String&gt; toDoList = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
                toDoList.add("Finish homework");
                toDoList.add("Go grocery shopping");
                toDoList.add("Call Grandma");
                
                // Now, let's prioritize 'Call Grandma' by moving it to the front of the list.
                toDoList.remove("Call Grandma");
                toDoList.addFirst("Call Grandma");
                
                // Print out the updated list
                System.out.println(toDoList);
                </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we've created a to-do list, adjusted
                        the priorities, and printed out the updated list.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Advantages of LinkedLists</h4>
                    <p>
                        Why use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList? Here are
                        some situations:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            When you need to frequently add or remove items from
                            the beginning or middle of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When memory space is fragmented, and it’s not
                            possible to allocate a large contiguous block of
                            memory for an array.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Your Task</h3>
                    <p>
                        Create a LinkedList to manage a simple waiting list for
                        a doctor's appointment system. Add patients to the list,
                        serve the first patient, and display the updated list
                        after each patient is served.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Applying LinkedLists</h4>
                    <p>
                        While ArrayLists are more popular due to their
                        constant-time positional access, LinkedLists excel in
                        scenarios where your application requires frequent
                        insertions and deletions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're designing a traffic management system, for
                        instance, cars entering and exiting a parking lot would
                        be a perfect real-life analogy to a LinkedList. Each car
                        (node) can enter (be added) or leave (be removed)
                        independently of the others without needing to move ever
                        car in the lot
                    </p>

                    <h2>Understanding Stacks in Java</h2>
                    <p>
                        Stacks are a fundamental data structure that follow a
                        particular order in which operations are performed. The
                        order is LIFO (Last In, First Out), meaning the last
                        element added to the stack will be the first one to be
                        removed. This structure is analogous to a stack of
                        plates; you add to the top and take from the top.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Operations of Stacks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's review the primary operations you can perform with
                        a Stack and their runtime complexities.

                    <h3>Implementing a Stack in Java</h3>
                    <p>
                        Java provides a <code>Stack</code> class that models
                        this data structure. Below is an example of how to use
                        it:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Stack&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;&gt;();
                    stack.push(10);
                    stack.push(20);
                    stack.push(30);
                    System.out.println(stack.peek()); // Outputs 30
                    stack.pop();
                    System.out.println(stack.peek()); // Outputs 20
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        In this code snippet, we're pushing elements onto the
                        stack and then popping the top element off to see how
                        LIFO is implemented.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Interactive Activity: Exploring Stack Operations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now it's your turn to try out these operations. Create a
                        stack to manage browser history, which allows you to go
                        back to the previous page.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Stack&lt;String&gt; browserHistory = new Stack&lt;&gt;();
                    browserHistory.push("Homepage");
                    browserHistory.push("About Us");
                    browserHistory.push("Contact Page");
                    
                    // Going back to the previous page
                    browserHistory.pop();
                    System.out.println("Current Page: " + browserHistory.peek());
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        As you follow this example, think about the order in
                        which pages are visited and how the stack allows you to
                        navigate back.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Runtime Complexity and Use Cases</h3>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the runtime complexity of stack operations
                        is crucial. Since all basic operations are O(1), stacks
                        are highly efficient for scenarios where you need to
                        manage elements in a LIFO manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common use cases for stacks include undo mechanisms in
                        text editors, call stack management in programming
                        languages, and for algorithms such as Depth-First Search
                        (DFS) in graph traversal.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Assignment: Implementing a Stack</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your task is to implement a stack that manages a series
                        of operations in a calculator app. The app should allow
                        the user to undo the last operation performed.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Stack&lt;String&gt; calculatorOperations = new Stack&lt;&gt;();
                    calculatorOperations.push("Add 5");
                    calculatorOperations.push("Multiply by 2");
                    calculatorOperations.push("Subtract 3");
                    
                    // Undo the last operation
                    calculatorOperations.pop();
                    System.out.println("Last Operation: " + calculatorOperations.peek());
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Think about how each operation affects the state of the
                        calculator and how you can use the stack to step back
                        through those states.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stacks are a powerful yet simple data structure that are
                        instrumental in many aspects of computer science and
                        software development. The LIFO principle can be applied
                        to a variety of problems, and understanding how to
                        effectively implement and utilize stacks will greatly
                        enhance your programming capabilities.

                    <h2>Introduction to Queues in Java</h2>
                    <p>
                        Queues are a fundamental data structure that operate on
                        a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This is similar
                        to a line of customers waiting in a bank: the first
                        customer to get in line is the first one to be served
                        and leave the line. Queues are widely used in
                        programming for managing data that needs to be processed
                        in the order it was received.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Essential Queue Operations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's examine the primary operations that can be
                        performed with a Queue and their runtime complexities.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>offer:</strong> Adds an item to the end of
                            the queue. <em>Runtime Complexity: O(1)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>poll:</strong> Removes and returns the item
                            at the front of the queue.
                            <em>Runtime Complexity: O(1)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>peek:</strong> Returns the item at the front
                            of the queue without removing it.
                            <em>Runtime Complexity: O(1)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>isEmpty:</strong> Checks if the queue is
                            empty.
                            <em>Runtime Complexity: O(1)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>size:</strong> Returns the number of items
                            in the queue. <em>Runtime Complexity: O(1)</em>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Queue Implementation in Java</h3>
                    <p>
                        Java provides several classes that implement the Queue
                        interface, including <code>LinkedList</code>, which can
                        also function as a Queue. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Queue&lt;Integer&gt; queue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
                    queue.offer(5);
                    queue.offer(10);
                    queue.offer(15);
                    System.out.println(queue.peek()); // Outputs 5
                    queue.poll();
                    System.out.println(queue.peek()); // Outputs 10
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This demonstrates enqueueing and dequeueing items from
                        the queue, adhering to the FIFO principle.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Interactive Activity: Working with Queues</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's time to put your knowledge into action. Create a
                        queue to simulate a customer service line, allowing
                        customers to be served in the order they arrive.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Queue&lt;String&gt; customerQueue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
                    customerQueue.offer("Customer 1");
                    customerQueue.offer("Customer 2");
                    customerQueue.offer("Customer 3");
                    
                    // Serve the first customer
                    customerQueue.poll();
                    System.out.println("Next Customer: " + customerQueue.peek());
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Follow this pattern to manage the service line
                        effectively, ensuring that each customer is served
                        fairly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Runtime Complexity and Practical Applications</h3>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the runtime complexity of queue operations
                        is important for performance considerations. All primary
                        queue operations have a runtime complexity of O(1),
                        making queues a highly efficient data structure for
                        managing sequential data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Queues are practical in numerous situations, such as
                        task scheduling, managing threads in multithreading, and
                        in algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph
                        traversal.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Assignment: Implementing a Queue</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this assignment, create a queue to manage printing
                        tasks sent to a printer. As tasks are completed, they
                        should be dequeued from the print queue.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Queue&lt;String&gt; printQueue = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
                    printQueue.offer("Document 1");
                    printQueue.offer("Document 2");
                    printQueue.offer("Photo 1");
                    
                    // Print the first document
                    printQueue.poll();
                    System.out.println("Printing: " + printQueue.peek());
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Consider how the FIFO principle is important for
                        ensuring that documents are printed in the correct
                        order.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Queues provide a structured approach to managing data
                        that needs to be processed sequentially. The FIFO nature
                        of queues ensures that all elements are processed in a
                        fair and orderly manner, mirroring many real-world
                        scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Experiment with the Queue data structure in your
                        projects and think about scenarios where maintaining the
                        order of processing is crucial. If you have any

                    <h2>Exploring Tree Data Structures in Java</h2>
                    <p>
                        Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of
                        nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the
                        root, and each node can have child nodes but only a
                        single parent, except for the root node which has no
                        parent.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts in Trees</h3>
                    <p>
                        A tree whose elements have at most two children is
                        called a binary tree. Each element in a tree can be
                        connected to two other elements, known as its children.
                        The element above is called the parent. Trees are used
                        to represent hierarchical structures, like file systems
                        or organizational structures.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tree Terminology</h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong>Node:</strong> An element of the tree.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Edge:</strong> The connection between two
                            nodes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Root:</strong> The top node without a
                            parent.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Leaf:</strong> A node without children.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Depth:</strong> The length of the path from
                            the root to the node.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> The length of the path from
                            the node to the deepest leaf.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Tree Operations and Runtime Complexity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Trees support various operations. The runtime complexity
                        for these operations can vary depending on the type of
                        tree and its balance.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Insert:</strong> Add a node to the tree.

                    <h3>Traversing a Tree</h3>
                    <p>
                        Traversing a tree means visiting all the nodes in a
                        specific order. There are several ways to do this:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>In-order (LNR):</strong> Visit the left
                            branch, then the current node, and finally, the
                            right branch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pre-order (NLR):</strong> Visit the current
                            node before its child nodes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Post-order (LRN):</strong> Visit the current
                            node after its child nodes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Level-order:</strong> Visit the nodes on
                            each level from left to right.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Example: Binary Search Tree (BST)</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Binary Search Tree is a tree in which all the nodes
                        follow the below properties:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or
                            equal to its parent node's key.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than
                            to its parent node's key.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments;
                        the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be
                        defined as:

                    <pre><code>class Node {

                    <h3>Assignment: Implementing a BST</h3>
                    <p>
                        Create a Binary Search Tree and perform the following
                        operations:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Insert multiple keys into the tree.</li>
                        <li>Delete a key from the tree.</li>
                        <li>Search for a key in the tree.</li>
                        <li>Perform an in-order traversal of the tree.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Consider how the operations maintain the BST properties
                        and how the traversal orders affect the output.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Trees are versatile data structures that can model
                        various real-world scenarios, such as organizational
                        hierarchies and decision processes. They are
                        particularly useful for storing sorted data and
                        facilitating fast retrieval.

                    <p>
                        Graphs are non-linear data structures composed of
                        vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect these
                        vertices. They are used to represent networks, such as
                        social networks, computer networks, and road maps.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Graph Terminology</h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong>Vertex:</strong> A node in the graph.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Edge:</strong> The connection between two
                            vertices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Adjacent:</strong> If two vertices are
                            connected by an edge, they are said to be adjacent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Path:</strong> A sequence of vertices where
                            each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <p>
                        Operations on graphs can vary in runtime complexity
                        based on the implementation and whether the graph is
                        directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and
                        other factors.

                    <h3>Representing Graphs in Java</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to represent graphs in Java. Two
                        of the most common representations are adjacency
                        matrices and adjacency lists.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Adjacency Matrix</h4>
                    <p>
                        An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where each cell [i][j]
                        indicates whether there is an edge from vertex i to
                        vertex j.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>int[][] adjacencyMatrix = {
                        {0, 1, 0, 0},
                        {1, 0, 1, 1},
                        {0, 1, 0, 1},
                        {0, 1, 1, 0}
                    };</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        A value of 1 indicates an edge, and a value of 0
                        indicates no edge.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Adjacency List</h4>
                    <p>
                        An adjacency list represents the graph as an array of
                        lists. The index of the array represents a vertex and
                        the list at that index contains the adjacent vertices.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt;[] adjacencyList = new List&lt;Integer&gt;[4];
                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
                        adjacencyList[i] = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
                    }
                    adjacencyList[0].add(1);
                    adjacencyList[1].add(0); adjacencyList[1].add(2); adjacencyList[1].add(3);
                    adjacencyList[2].add(1); adjacencyList[2].add(3);
                    adjacencyList[3].add(1); adjacencyList[3].add(2);</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This represents a bidirectional graph (or an undirected
                        graph).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Exploring Graph Algorithms</h3>
                    <p>
                        Several algorithms allow us to traverse or search
                        through graphs. Two fundamental algorithms are:

                            data structures. It starts at the root node and
                            explores as far as possible along each branch before
                            backtracking.

                            structures. It starts at the tree root and explores
                            the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next
                            level neighbors.

                <h4>Getting Started with Algorithms</h4>
                <section id="merge-sort">
                    <h2>Merge Sort Algorithm Explained</h2>
                    <p>
                        Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that
                        divides the input array into two halves, calls itself
                        for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted
                        halves. The merge() function is used for merging two
                        halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is a key process that
                        assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and
                        merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Steps of the Merge Sort Algorithm</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each
                            containing one element (a list of one element is
                            considered sorted).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted
                            sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.
                            This will be the sorted list.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Runtime Complexity of Merge Sort</h3>
                    <p>
                        The runtime complexity of Merge Sort in all cases
                        (worst, average, and best) is O(n log n), because the
                        list is being split in log(n) parts and the merging
                        process takes linear time in each part.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Example: Sorting an Array with Merge Sort</h4>
                    <pre><code>public class MergeSort {

                                // Find sizes of two subarrays to be merged

                        creating a simple array of integers and then apply the

                        Merge Sort is a powerful sorting algorithm, especially
                        useful for large datasets. Its divide-and-conquer
                        approach is a great example of an efficient, scalable
                        algorithm that applies to many sorting applications.

                        <h2>Understanding QuickSort in Java</h2>
                        <p>
                            QuickSort is an efficient, in-place sorting
                            algorithm that utilizes a divide and conquer
                            strategy to sort elements. It works by selecting a
                            'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the
                            other elements into two sub-arrays, according to
                            whether they are less than or greater than the
                            pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Steps of the QuickSort Algorithm</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Choose an element from the array as the pivot
                                (typically the last element).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Partition the other elements into two
                                sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and
                                elements greater than the pivot.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Recursively apply the above steps to the
                                sub-arrays.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Combine the sub-arrays to form the sorted array.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Runtime Complexity of QuickSort</h3>
                        <p>
                            The average and best-case runtime complexity of
                            QuickSort is O(n log n), but the worst-case
                            complexity is O(n^2), which occurs when the smallest
                            or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.
                            However, with good pivot selection methods, the
                            worst-case complexity is rarely encountered.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Example: Implementing QuickSort</h4>
                        <pre><code>class QuickSort {

                                int i = (low - 1); // index of smaller element

                                    // If current element is smaller than the pivot
                                    if (arr[j] &lt; pivot) {

                                    // pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place

                        <p>
                            It's time for you to practice QuickSort. Begin with
                            an unsorted array of integers and then apply the
                            QuickSort algorithm to sort it. Here is an array you
                            can use for testing:

                        <p>
                            Implement the QuickSort algorithm and then print out
                            the sorted array to ensure it's correctly sorted.

                    <h2>Heap Sort Algorithm in Java</h2>
                    <p>
                        Heap Sort is a popular comparison-based sorting
                        technique based on binary heap data structure. It's
                        similar to selection sort where we first find the
                        maximum element and place the maximum element at the
                        end. We repeat the same process for the remaining
                        elements.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts of Heap Sort</h3>
                    <p>
                        Heap Sort introduces the use of a heap to manage the
                        sort order. A heap is a special tree-based data
                        structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max
                        heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater
                        than or equal to the values of its children, and the
                        heap is a complete binary tree.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Heap Sort Steps and Runtime Complexity</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a max heap from the input data.</li>
                        <li>
                            At this point, the largest item is stored at the
                            root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of
                            the heap, reducing the heap size by one. Finally,
                            heapify the root of the tree.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater
                            than one.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The runtime complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n) for
                        all cases (best, average, and worst) as the tree height
                        is log(n) and each level of tree takes O(n) time to
                        process.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Example: Implementing Heap Sort</h4>
                    <pre><code>public class HeapSort {
                            public void sort(int arr[]) {

                    <h3>Interactive Activity: Running Heap Sort</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now, let's put Heap Sort into action. Start with an
                        unsorted array, turn it into a heap, and then sort it
                        using the Heap Sort algorithm. Try with this array:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>int[] arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        After implementing the Heap Sort algorithm, print out
                        the array to verify it has been sorted correctly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Heap Sort is a great algorithm for cases where a fast
                        and stable sort is needed without the need for
                        additional memory use for merge sort, or the quick
                        sort's worst-case O(n^2) runtime. It’s particularly
                        useful when you're working with heaps and priority
                        queues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By practicing Heap Sort, you enhance your understanding
                        of how binary heaps function and how they can be used to
                        maintain a sorted state. If you encounter any challenges

                    <h2>Binary Search Algorithm in Java</h2>
                    <p>
                        Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an
                        item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly
                        dividing in half the portion of the list that could
                        contain the item until you've narrowed the possible
                        locations to just one.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Understanding Binary Search</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main idea of binary search is to divide the
                        collection in half with each iteration. For the
                        algorithm to work, it must be applied to a sorted
                        collection. It compares the target value to the middle
                        element of the collection; if they are not equal, the
                        half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and
                        the search continues on the remaining half until the
                        item is found or the search space is empty.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Binary Search Steps and Runtime Complexity</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find the middle element of the array.</li>
                        <li>
                            If the middle element is equal to the target, return
                            the index of the middle element.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the middle element is greater than the target,
                            repeat the search on the left subarray.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the middle element is less than the target,
                            repeat the search on the right subarray.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The runtime complexity of binary search is O(log n)
                        since with each iteration, the search space is halved.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Example: Implementing Binary Search</h4>
                    <pre><code>class BinarySearch {
                            // Returns index of x if it is present in arr[l..r], else return -1
                            int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x) {
                                if (r >= l) {
                                    int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
                        
                                    // If the element is present at the middle itself
                                    if (arr[mid] == x)
                                        return mid;
                        
                                    // If element is smaller than mid, then it can only be present in left subarray
                                    if (arr[mid] > x)
                                        return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x);
                        
                                    // Else the element can only be present in right subarray
                                    return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x);
                                }
                        
                                // We reach here when element is not present in array
                                return -1;
                            }
                        }
                        </code></pre>

                    <h3>Interactive Activity: Running Binary Search</h3>
                    <p>
                        Try implementing binary search on your own. Begin with
                        the following sorted array of integers:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>int[] arr = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Use the binary search function to find the position of
                        the number 10 in the array. Once you've implemented the
                        binary search, verify that your function returns the
                        correct index.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Binary Search is a powerful algorithm that allows for
                        quick searching through sorted data. It's a fundamental
                        tool in computer science, applicable in many scenarios
                        where quick search is critical. Understanding how to
                        implement and apply binary search will greatly improve
                        your problem-solving skills.
